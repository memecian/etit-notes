# Atoms and Nuclei
## History

### Ancient Greece
- Matter is composed of small **indivisible** units (indivisible = atom) => Atoms
- Atoms determine properties of matter
### 19th Century 
#### 5 Postulates by John Dalton (1808)
- Elements are made of small particles called Atoms
- Atoms of a given Element are identical in size, mass and other properties
- Atoms cannot be subdivided, created or destroyed
- Atoms of simple elements compound in simple whole-number ratios to form compounds
- In chemical reactions, atoms are combined, separated or rearranged
#### Dmitri Mendeleev: Periodic Table of Elements (1869)
- 63 Elements known at the time
- Gaps for unknowns left in place
- "THE TABLE"
#### End of century
- C. Roentgen: Discovery of X-Rays (1895)
- Henry Becquerel: Discovery of "spontaneous" Radioactivity (1896)
- J.J. Thompson. Discovery of the Electron (Cathode Rays) (1897)
	-  1902: Plum-Pudding atom model
### 20th Century
#### E. Rutherford: Planetary Atom/Nuclear Atom (1911)
- Electrons move around a positively charged central nucleus
- Scatter experiments showed:
	- diameter of nucleus ~ $5E-15$ meters
	- radius of atoms ~ $1E-10$ meters
	Demonstration of scale: Cherry kernel and Cologne Cathedral, where kernel = nucleus, Cathedral tower - electron orbit radius
	**⚡ Model violates classical theory - Electrons should emit radiation**
#### N. Bohr "Quantum" model of Hydrogen Atom (1913)
- Electrons orbit around nucleus in discrete energy states without emitting radiation.
- Allowed states for and electron are those for which the orbital angular momentum L is an integral multiple of $h/2\pi$ ... (h = Planck-constant)
- Electron jumps from a higher energy state $E_2$ to $E_1$ radiation of frequency f is emitted, where $h*f = E_2 -E_1$
- Only valid for Hydrogen
#### A. Sommerfeld: 2nd Quantum Number (1916)
- Discovery of elliptical orbits -> Bohr model applicable and valid for all elements
### L. de Broglie: Wave/Particle duality for "massive particles" (1924)
- All particles behave like waves
- Wavelength and Momentum are related by $\lambda = h/P$
#### E. Schrödinger: Quantum mechanical Atom (1926)
- Electrpns as three-dimensional waveforms
#### W. Heisenberg: Uncertainty Principle (1927)
- Position and Momentum of Particle *cannot* be exactly measured at the same time
#### Common interpretation
Atomic orbital zones around the nucleus where a given electron is most likely to be observed.
