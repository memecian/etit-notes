# Atoms and Nuclei
## History

### Ancient Greece
- Matter is composed of small **indivisible** units (indivisible = atom) => Atoms
- Atoms determine properties of matter
### 19th Century 
#### John Dalton: 5 Postulates (1808)
- Elements are made of small particles called Atoms
- Atoms of a given Element are identical in size, mass and other properties
- Atoms cannot be subdivided, created or destroyed
- Atoms of simple elements compound in simple whole-number ratios to form compounds
- In chemical reactions, atoms are combined, separated or rearranged
#### Dmitri Mendeleev: Periodic Table of Elements (1869)
- 63 Elements known at the time
- Gaps for unknowns left in place
- "THE TABLE"
#### End of century
- C. Roentgen: Discovery of X-Rays (1895)
- Henry Becquerel: Discovery of "spontaneous" Radioactivity (1896)
- J.J. Thompson. Discovery of the Electron (Cathode Rays) (1897)
> 	Since electrons can be extracted from all chemical elements, one must
	conclude that they are part of the constitution of all atoms."

-> 1902: Plum-Pudding atom model
### 20th Century - Atomic Structure and Nuclei
#### E. Rutherford: Planetary Atom/Nuclear Atom (1911)
- Electrons move around a positively charged central nucleus
- Scatter experiments showed:
	- diameter of nucleus ~ $5E-15$ meters
	- radius of atoms ~ $1E-10$ meters
	Demonstration of scale: Cherry kernel and Cologne Cathedral, where kernel = nucleus, Cathedral tower - electron orbit radius
	**⚡ Model violates classical theory - Electrons should emit radiation**
#### N. Bohr "Quantum" model of Hydrogen Atom (1913)
- Electrons orbit around nucleus in discrete energy states without emitting radiation.
- Allowed states for and electron are those for which the orbital angular momentum L is an integral multiple of $h/2\pi$, i.e. $L = \frac{n*h}{2\pi}$ ← (n = quantum number for discrete energy state,  h = Planck constant)
- Electron jumps from a higher energy state $E_2$ to $E_1$ radiation of frequency f is emitted, where $h*f = E_2 -E_1$
- Only valid for Hydrogen
#### A. Sommerfeld: 2nd Quantum Number (1916)
- Discovery of elliptical orbits → Bohr model applicable and valid for all elements
#### L. de Broglie: Wave/Particle duality for "massive particles" (1924)
- All particles behave like waves to an extent
- Wavelength and Momentum are related by $\lambda = h/P$
#### E. Schrödinger: Quantum mechanical Atom (1926)
- Electrons as three-dimensional waveforms
#### W. Heisenberg: Uncertainty Principle (1927)
- Position and Momentum of Particle **cannot** be exactly measured at the same time
#### Common interpretation

(Page 12)
-  Atomic orbital zones around the nucleus where a given electron is most likely to be observed.
- Electrons in atoms are distinguished by quantum numbers
- Electrons indistinguishable in bonds (as per Bohr model)

## Atomic Nucleus

### Characterized by:
- #Z= $n_{Protons}$ (Element number)
- #N=  $n_{Neutrons}$
- #A = #Z + #N = $n_{Nucleons}$ (~ mass of nucleus in AMU)
- #Isotope s : Nuclei with same Z but different N (and A) 
### Notation conventions:
X = chemical element.
#### $_Z^A X$
e.g. $_{92}^{238}U$
#### $^A X$
e.g $^{238}U$
#### X-A (Physicists are lazy)
e.g. U-238
### Forces
Size of nucleus: $R=r_0 * A^{\frac{1}{3}}$, where $r_0 = 1.2\; femto\;meter\, (fm)$
#### Coulomb force
- repulsive for proton-proton
- infinite range
#### Nuclear force
- attractive independent of nucleon type
- very short range ($max.\; 3 fm = (3*10^{-15})m$)
#### Binding energy = Mass defect





Fusion only usable on light atoms (hydrogen), fission for heavy ones (uranium) p. 25
fusion bombs are fission bombs with extra steps


## Decay (p.32)
decay only dependent on nucleus - phase, temperature etc does not matter
Parent nucleus + decay -> Daughter/Progeny nucleus
