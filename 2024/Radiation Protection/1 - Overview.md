## Terms; Radiation Protection and Health Physics

- #Radiation 
	- subset of electromagnetic waves combined with a class of _energetic_ subatomic particles with high kinetic energies. These are called **ionizing radiation**, and the particles are termed particle radiation.
	- "energy in motion"

- #Protection:
    - The process of keeping something or someone safe.
    - The state of being safe.
    - A means of keeping or remaining safe.

- #Radiation_Protection:
    - aka radiological protection
    - science and practice of protecting people & the environment from the harmful effects of ionizing radiation.

- #Health_Physics or Physics of Radiation Protection
    - science concerned with:
        - recognition
        - evaluation
        - control
		of health hazards to permit the safe use and application of ionizing radiation.

**Interdisciplinary Jigsaw Puzzle**

3 Categories of protected people:
1. General public
2. Workers
3. Medical staff

Medical staff has additional measure: Justification of radiation usage:
- Fractured bone/Major injury? -> CT scan -> Usage of radiation is justified
- "Stress detection" using portable scanners? -> Ethically questionable -> unjustified

### Basic Principles of Radiation Protection (ICRP)

1. Justification
2. Optimisation
3. Dose Limitation

Important factors:
- Time of exposure
- Distance
- Shielding
- Activity (amount of radiation)

#ALARA - As low as reasonably achievable

## Why do we care about Radiation Protection / Health Physics?

- ionizing Radiation and its applications
- Radiobiological chain

Ionizing Radiation: Release charged particles in matter during interaction with matter (ionization)

Discovery of Radiation:
- Röntgen (1895): X-Rays from Cathode tubes
- Becquerel (1896): Radioactivity

Application of X-Rays and Radionuclides in medicine since 1896 (!):
- 1896 - First medical xray images
- 1899 - first reports of radeonuclide-therapy
- 1913 - tracer principle (nuclear medicine basis) by George von Hevesy

A fuckton of things have been discovered through radiation physics (2 slides, not relevant to the exam)

### Applications of ionizing radiation
- Research:
	- Radioanalytics (e.g. traces methods, dating)
	- X-Ray structure analysis
- Technical Applications
	- Nuclear Energy
	- Sterilization by irradiation
	- non-destructive testing (Hulls, reactor walls etc.)
- Medical applications
	- Diagnosis and therapy (Radiology, Nuclear medicine, Radiooncology)
- Security
	- Baggage screening at airports
- Military applications
	- Nuclear Bombs
	- Targeting systems
	
### Interaction of Radiation with living cells:

## Radiation Protection: How?

### Natural sciences/Medicine:
- Basic knowledge about radiation:
	- Sources and types of radiation
	- interaction of radiation with matter
-  Knowledge and understanding of radiation effects
### Engineering
- Measurements instrumentation for ionizing radiation
- Technical application of radiation (e.g. XRay machines)
- Technical protection (shutdown circuits/emergency shutdown)
### Standardization
- Definition of Quantities
- Definition of Units

### #Dosimetry (quantification of exposure)
- Dose = energy deposited by ionizing radiation per mass
	- Account for biological effectiveness using weighting factors
### #Epidemiology (Assesment/Evaluation of exposure)
- Definition of Measure: Detriment
- Dose-Response-Relationship
![[img/HealthRiskModels.png]]
Risk of deadly cancer 5% per Sv (0.005% per mSv)

### Legal
- International Norms and ICRP/IAEA recommendations
	- EU - EURATOM Treaty
		-  DE - Grundgesetz + Atomgesetz + RöV,StrlSchV ...
			- DIN/ISO Norms
### (Inter)national Organitations in Radiological Protection
- Science : UNSCEAR
- Principles: ICRP
- Standards: IAEA, EC, ISO, IEC
- Practice: IRPA, EURADOS
All working together for safe and standardized Radiation stuff.

 It is a problem of philosophy, and morality, and the utmost wisdom”
